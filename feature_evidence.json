      "featureTitle": "In `frontend/src/pages/PositionRecovery.tsx`, decouple the detected deeply-negative positions state from any automatic polling or periodic re-fetch cycle. The list of positions detected by `positionRecoveryEngine` must be stored in a dedicated local React state variable that is only updated when: (a) the page first mounts (initial load), or (b) the user explicitly clicks the Refresh button. Any background polling (e.g., price polling, Dashboard re-renders, or shared state updates) must NOT clear, overwrite, or trigger a re-evaluation of this state. The displayed list must remain stable until the user manually triggers a refresh.",
