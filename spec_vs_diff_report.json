  "summary": "The diff implements the required fix for the 'Test Connection' flow in useCredentials.ts. It uses `getAccount` from `binanceAccountService.ts` (which internally uses the CORS proxy), generates HMAC-SHA256 signatures client-side via `binanceAuth.ts`, provides human-readable error messages, displays account balance on success, and updates Settings.tsx with a CORS proxy notice. The implementation appears to satisfy all REQ-20 acceptance criteria based on available evidence.",

      "reason": "The build request only asks to fix useCredentials.ts (and Settings.tsx if needed for displaying balance/errors). Adding a Portuguese-language informational warning banner about the CORS proxy was not part of REQ-20 or any other stated requirement.",
