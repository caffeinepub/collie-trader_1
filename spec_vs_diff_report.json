  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to frontend/src/pages/PositionRecovery.tsx that implement stable local state management for recovery positions. The file summary confirms: a useRef mount guard ensures initial fetch runs exactly once, recoveryData state is only mutated by the mount load or explicit Refresh button click, and currentPrice is stored per position snapshot to avoid dependency on external price state. This aligns well with both REQ-47 and REQ-48. The diff content is truncated but shows the key patterns: useState([]) initialization, useRef mount guard, useCallback for analyzePositions, and import of getPositionRisk from binanceAccountService.",
